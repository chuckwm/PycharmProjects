# Modify the program below to use a while loop to
# allow as many guesses as necessary.
#
# The program should let the player know whether to
# guess higher or lower, and should print a message
# when the guess is correct. A correct guess will
# terminate the program.
#
# As an optional extra, allow the player to quit by entering
# 0 (zero) for their guess.
